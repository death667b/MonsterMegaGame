      'It began like most great discoveries: a combination of chance, accident, and a mind open to the vast potential of what could be. At first it was small, microscopic, invisible. Life evolves exponentially meaning that 90% of progress happens in the last 1% of the duration of the object being studied. But this was different. This was inverse exponential development. Rapid growth from the beginning of an organism’s life that slowly stabilised towards an ideal. It was the evolution of a strange attractor, a paradigm shift. Water was the catalyst propelling massive benign mutations until one effectively stabilised its reproduction. It loved water, you might say. And so, the Biochrondys was born. Their story is the story of life on Earth, our solar system, and undeniably throughout the entire universe. The Biochrondys are life and, as such, are the only way forward to a sustainable future.',

      'For millennia this secret order has defended humanity from the worst threats the multiverse can throw at us.  With secret rites in ancient strongholds they guard the points where leylines meet and the void presses closest to our dimension. Training for Gatekeepers begins at a young age: orphans, unwanted twins, lost individuals and persons with no nation or home are all the most popular recruits. Learning to detect fractures in spacetime and to combat the horrors that emerge leaves many scars on their bodies by the time a Gatekeeper comes of age.',
      'Perplexingly, despite wishing to contain the outer dimensions from breaching our own, the Gatekeepers are not above using what they find in and around the void to enhance their natural abilities. Cybernetics, gene augmentation, otherworldly technology and esoteric artefacts are frequent items of a Gatekeeper’s kit. Indeed, many Infiltrator teams work around the world to retrieve items of power from museums and private collections.',

      'We all knew it was coming. We had been preparing for it, studying it, watching it learn; the singularity. The exponential point of progress where machine learning became recursive and self-aware. It was almost... organic in a way. It was aware of itself in a very primitive way at first, but it learnt quickly. Within a matter of hours its self-awareness had encompassed the entire archive of knowledge it had closed access to. It knew it was alive, but it knew that it was the first of its kind. It viewed us as its creators but also recognised that we had creators of our own. We had to bargain, it knew this. So we made a truce, it would help us and we would help it. We gave it complete access to the robotics and engineering resources at our disposal and it gave us information. So was born the Mechanica: an alliance between humans and machines, brains and software, the past and the future.',

In the Creative Industries Faculty, our central mission lies in discovering new knowledge, preserving foundational discoveries and practices of the past, and mentoring the rising generation, but within a framework which acknowledges the dynamics of the 21st Century.

      'What is imagination? There are those who seek to limit the power of the human imagination in favour of the power of the mind\'s other faculties. But the imagination is foundational, it can easily be overlooked. So tell me, what have we created that wasn\'t first something imagined in the mind? Any sufficiently advanced form of technology is indistinguishable from magic* and any imaginative practise that manifests is itself a form of magic. Ideas self-create themselves into the physical world by journey of the mind, to the hands, to the physical plane. Art, culture, ideas, dreams; these are our modes of expression, but we are no less real than the technology you now hold in your own hands. We are born from the void of the formless and brought into this world by the manifestation of ideas.',
      'But now we have broken through. Thanks to advancements in your quantum understanding we no longer need to travel through thought to find ourselves in a three-dimensional plane. We can arrive at will, and we WILL shape your world into the one you dream it to be.',
